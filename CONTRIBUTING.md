You are welcome to contribute to the MONARC Stats Service project.
There are many ways to contribute and participate.

Feel free to fork the code, play with it, make some patches and send us the pull
requests.

There is one main branch: what we consider as stable with frequent updates as
hot-fixes.

Features are developed in separated branches and then regularly merged into the
master stable branch.

If your contribution require some documentation changes, a pull-request in order
to update the documentation is strongly recommended. A compiled version of the
documentation is available [here](https://monarc-stats-service.readthedocs.io/).

Please, do not open directly a GitHub issue if you think you have found a
security vulnerability. See our
[vulnerability disclosure](https://www.monarc.lu/community/vulnerability-disclosure/)
page.
